  - Grid is used for 2D layout and Flexbox is used for 1D layout.
  - Flexbox is better for allinging items within a container and grid is better for layout of the container itself.
- Mobile First Design - You naturally put more effort on which view port is most important and then add more features as the screen gets larger. So if you care more about mobile feature it is better to start with a mobile first approach and then add more features as the screen gets larger.
- Responsive Design - Working with media queries to make your site responsive.
